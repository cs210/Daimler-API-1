Daimler vehicles are connected to the cloud and make their data and functions accessible via APIs. We have launched this feature in Europe and are currently rolling it out in the US market. Be among the first to access vehicle data and functions to build exciting apps around your vehicle. Monitor charging levels, doors, windows, lights, and more. We will build an app that uses our connected vehicle APIs to build a great customer experience.
